NumPy Notes (June 12, 2025):
- NumPy arrays are efficient for numerical data.
- Created 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.
- shape shows dimensions, size counts elements.
- Modified elements and reshaped arrays.

NumPy Notes (June 13, 2025):
- NumPy handles 7.5M elements efficiently with arange().
- Vectorized operations (np.sum()) are faster than Python lists.
- Filtered even numbers with boolean indexing.
- Speedup depends on system but typically 10-50x.

NumPy Notes (June 13, 2025):
- Vectorized operations (e.g., **2, +) are faster than loops.
- Squared 7.5M elements in ~0.03s vs. ~0.25s with Python.
- Element-wise addition works directly on arrays.
- Improves performance for large datasets.

NumPy Notes (June 13, 2025):
- Reshaped 1D arrays to 2x3 with reshape().
- Fixed vstack error by matching shapes (2x3 for both).
- Concatenated with vstack() and hstack().
- Performed addition, dot product, and sqrt() on matrices.
- Vectorization improves efficiency for large data.
