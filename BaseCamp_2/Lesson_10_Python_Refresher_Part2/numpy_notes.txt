NumPy Notes (June 12, 2025):
- NumPy arrays are efficient for numerical data.
- Created 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.
- shape shows dimensions, size counts elements.
- Modified elements and reshaped arrays.

NumPy Notes (June 13, 2025):
- NumPy handles 7.5M elements efficiently with arange().
- Vectorized operations (np.sum()) are faster than Python lists.
- Filtered even numbers with boolean indexing.
- Speedup depends on system but typically 10-50x.
