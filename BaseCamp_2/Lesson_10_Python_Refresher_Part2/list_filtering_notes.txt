List Comprehension Filtering Notes (June 11, 2025):
- Filtering adds 'if' condition to [expression for item in iterable if condition].
- Even squares: [x**2 for x in numbers if x%2==0] filters even numbers.
- Large numbers: [x for x in numbers if x>10] selects values above 10.
- Divisible by 4: [x for x in numbers if x%4==0 and x%2==0] uses multiple conditions.
